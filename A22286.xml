            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue many times heretofore expreſſed the great care and deſire We</hi> alwayes had, that the Common High-wayes and Bridges within this Realme, might be kept in due repayre, for the generall eaſe and good of Our louing Subiects, and haue giuen many and often directions to Our Priuie Counſell, Iudges, and other Officers, for effecting thereof; And finding a chiefe cauſe of the exceeding decayes thereof, to be the extraordinary carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with Carts, and Wagons with foure wheeles, carrying exceſſiue bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, whereby the High-wayes are ſo galled, and the very foundations of any Ordinary Bridges ſhaken, that no ordinary repayre can maintaine and keepe the ſame paſſable: We did heretofore cauſe Our Iudges to aduiſe thereof, by whom Wee were reſolued, that thoſe extraordinary carriages were common Nuſances and annoyances againſt the Weale Publique, and the vſe of them an offence againſt Our Crowne and Lawes: Wee did therefore by Our Proclamation, in the ſixteenth yeere of Our Reigne of England, prohibite the going or trauailing with any ſuch Cart or Wagon. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all which, and the great care, aſwell of Our Priuie Counſell, as of Our Iudges in their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuites, We finde no amendement, but that the High wayes, not onely in the remoter parts, but alſo in places of Our owne vſuall acceſſe, are ſtill ſpoyled and ploughed vp by thoſe vnreaſonable carriages, ſo as they continue ſtill ſo foule and deepe, as they are oft times almoſt vnpaſſable. We therefore inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding redreſſe and reformation in the Premiſſes, and being reſolued, that for the effecting thereof, a more ſeuere and ſtrict courſe be taken then hath beene heretofore, haue thought it agreeable to Our owne princely goodneſſe, once more to warne Our Subiects thereof, that ſuch as ſhall hereafter of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and ſhall be iuſtly puniſhed therefore, may be altogether vnexcuſable.</p>
            <p>And therefore, We doe by this Our Proclamation, and by the aduiſe of the Lords and others of Our Priuie Counſel, ſtraitly charge, require and command; That no common Carryer, or other perſon, or perſons whatſoeuer, ſhal from, and after the Feaſt of S. Michael the Arch-angel, now next comming, vſe, goe, or trauell with any Cart, or Wagon, made with foure wheeles, nor with any other Cart or Wagon whatſoeuer, but onely ſuch Wagons and Carts, as ſhall haue but two wheeles; and that they doe not cary in any Wayne, Cart, or carryage, to be after that time vſed, any load or burthen, aboue the weight of twentie hundred, nor ſhall draw, or vſe their ſaid Cards, or waynes, or carryages, with more then fiue horſes at once in their iourney, vpon paine of our heauy indignation, and diſpleaſure, and of the ſeuereſt cenſure of Our high Court of Star Chamber, and ſuch further paines, puniſhments, and impriſonments, as by the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme may be inflicted vpon the offendors, for ſuch their offence and contempt.</p>
            <p>And therefore We doe hereby require Our Atturney generall, for the time being, vpon notice giuen vnto him of any ſuch offendor, or offendors, to prôſecute him, and them in the ſaid high Court of Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, there to receiue ſuch cenſure and puniſhment, by fine, impriſonment, and otherwiſe, as their contempts and offences againſt this Our Royall Command ſhall deſerue. And laſtly, We doe hereby will and require, all Maiors, Sheriffes, Bayliffes, Iuſtices of Peace, and other Our Officers, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, in all Counties, and priuiledged places whatſoeuer, within this Our Realme, That they, and euery of them, in their ſeuerall Offices, and places, doe from time to time prouide, and ſee to the due exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this Our pleaſure, and Royall Commandement; And that they diſcouer and make knowne all offendors herein, that they may be ſeuerely puniſhed for their offences and contempts; As alſo, that they neglect not, but continue the repaire and maintenance of High-wayes, Bridges, and Cauſeys with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Our Realme, according to the Lawes, Statutes, and Ordinances now in force, and Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement heretofore giuen, as they tender Our pleaſure, and will anſwere the contrary, at their vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt perills.</p>
